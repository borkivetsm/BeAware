        <p>Companies that have not left the Russian market continue to earn a lot of money there. From this money, 
            companies pay taxes to Russia. For example, in 2022, international companies, that are staying in Russia 
            and which have completed withdrawal, made over 213.9 billion dollars. They paid Russia 3.5 billion dollars in profit taxes. 
            International companies that stay in Russia, pay some other taxes too, income tax on employees' salaries, social insurance payments,
             and VAT. Then all this money from taxes goes to various industries. The military industry is not an exception. Moreover, Russia now 
             invests in the war a very large part of the money that comes from taxes. With this money, Russia buys weapons, military equipment, 
             missiles, and so on. 
        </p>
        <p>
             Besides, a lot of international companies are doing humanitarian aid for Russians. Under international law, 
            humanitarian aid can only be given to civilians. Nevertheless, international companies are providing humanitarian aid for Russian soldiers.
             The Russian government created a rule according to which companies that continue to work in Russia must provide tools for war,
              as well as humanitarian aid for the military. For example “Auchan” put warm socks, cigarettes, lighters, and razors in humanitarian aid.
               This company also did not put anything for women or children. The organizations that conducted the investigation say that this 
               humanitarian aid was for Ashan employees who were mobilized.

        <h2>WHAT ARE THE GOALS OF OUR PROJECT?</h2>
        <p>
            Since the beginning of the full-scale war in Ukraine, many global companies have left the Russian market. 
            These international companies do not want to tarnish their names, 
            they want to have a good reputation and they are simply scared of doing business in Russia because it is too risky. 
            But there are still a lot of global companies that did not stop their businesses there. That is why we want:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>to tell people about this problem and raise their awareness of how the companies that are doing business in Russia contribute to wars</li>
            <li>to convince as many people as possible from different countries that it is bad that companies remain in Russia</li>
            <li>to force international companies that continue to do business in Russia, to think about what they are doing and to put values over money</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>WHY SHOULD COMPANIES LEAVE RUSSIA?</h2>
        <p>
            Russia was involved in 8 wars in 30 years. This is quite a large number. Russia was involved in wars in different parts of the world. 
            Sometimes Russia provoked wars, sometimes helped as an ally, and sometimes started them. That is why our topic is global. 
            Russia has started many wars, and because of this global companies that stay in Russia contribute to these wars.

                Contact these companies by email or social media call them to stop doing business in Russia, 
                and explain to them why the fact that they stay in Russia is a problem.
